There are multiple ways to make use of a language server within the vim ecosystem.

- :doc:`coc.nvim </lsp/editors/vim-coc>` a fully featured language client that aims to closely follow the
  way VSCode works. Despite what the name implies it includes supports for both
  vim8 and neovim
- :doc:`vim-lsp </lsp/editors/vim-lsp>` an async LSP plugin for vim8 and neovim.
- :doc:`neovim </lsp/editors/nvim>` neovim v0.5+ comes with built-in support for the language server protocol.
